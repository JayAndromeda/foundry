## Roll Editor

- Added an option to hide perk effect badges

## Compare

- Fixed an issue that would prevent adding a weapon roll to Compare when it had the same perks as a previously added roll, but with different perk effect values 
- Added perk effect badge display to the column header
  - **Note:** If you had a Compare session active from before these changes, you'll need to re-add those rolls to be able to see the badges
