## General

- Should now disable Dark Reader on the site by default for folks that use that extension, as we're currently dark mode only and their styles cause a bunch of visual errors.
- Updated the templating of some of our Open Graph metadata

## Roll Editor

- Improves performance of advanced stat rendering
- Improves page loading performance
- Hides certian accordion sections at a weapon family level when they're not needed
- Tooltips for advanced stats should now respect user settings for thousands and decimal separators
- Fixed an issue where Point of the Stag was missing its Masterwork
