## Search

- Moves Search into a Dialog to create a more "focused" view.
  - Both Search and the Weapon pages already have a lot going on visually, so this helps give a bit more space for Search to breathe.
  - Additionally, this resolves an issue with the Search menu where if it was the last element focused, you leave the window, and then click back into the window to refocus -- it would reopen and could result in accidentally clicking on one of the search results and going to that page. Now it'll stay open if you leave the page, and also won't randomly re-open on window focus
- Refined some of the styles and animations for Search to better fit with our design system.

## General

- Adds a custom scroll area to the site's layout.
  - This looks nicer, and also resolves an issue with the layout shifting when certain modal elements (such as our Select, Dialog, etc) removed the scroll bar.

## Roll Editor

- Fixes a 1px layout shift on switching between Single/Multi Select
- Fixes an issue with Bipod's reserve bonus not applying

## Documentation Center

- Fixes an issue with the Table of Contents not scrolling to the section
- Hides the redundant top level link in the Table of Contents
- Adds Forward/Back bottom navigation buttons to child doc pages
