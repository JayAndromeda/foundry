## Additions

- Added banner to Perk Tooltip with level requirements on crafted weapons
- Added option to Compare items to pin to the left

## Modifications

- Slightly changed styling of Compare header
- Added extra padding to bottom of Compare horizontal scroll container

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue with bonuses from enhanced traits + masterwork not applying on Compare
- Applied a stopgap for an issue with crafted masterwork/enhanced intrinsic bonuses applying +3 rather than +2
  - This should functionally work as expected now
  - An update will come at some point in the future to actually base these bonuses off enhanced intrinsics rather than masterworks as we currently do
