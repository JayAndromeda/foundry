## General

- You can now choose from 3 theme contrast levels under Preferences > Appearance
  - "Soft" is a lower contrast mode, with a lighter gray background and text
  - "Medium" is the default theme
  - "Hard" is most similar to our older theme, a black background with off-white text. Good if you prefer a more contrast-y experience or are using an OLED/AMOLED screen
  - More improvemnts/refinements to these will come in the future, but they should be ready for use!

## Roll Editor

- Fixed urls for a few buff icons that broke with the Season update
