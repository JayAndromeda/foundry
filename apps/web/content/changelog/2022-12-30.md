## Additions

- Added 3 new filters to Search
  - `season`
  - `adept`
  - `craftable`
- Added "expand" option for Filter keyword suggestions
- Added animation for Search dropdown when it changes height
- Added footer with helper text to Search at desktop sizes
- Added preview/placeholder text to Search input when option is highlighted
- Added custom styles for scrollbars

## Modifications

- Increased size of Search suggestion options at mobile screen sizes
- Updated styles of Search for better visual distinction between elements on mobile
- Removed native mobile autocorrect/autocomplete for Search input
- Changed behavior of Filter keyword suggestions to not present options that were already selected and that can't be combined through boolean AND logic
- Changed display of Filter value suggestions to include quotation marks for options with spaces
- Changed search option headings to stick to top of scroll container
- Updated styles of Settings Dropdown to more closely match Search
- Moved some pixels

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue due to static generation where changing between different screen sizes would result in mobile/desktop styles to get mashed together for Search
- Fixed an issue where several movement-based animations were still playing when users had system settings to prefer reduced motion
- Fixed an issue where the cmd/ctrl+k prompt was too translucent
