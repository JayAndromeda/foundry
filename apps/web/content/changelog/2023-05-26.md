## Roll Editor

- Fixed an issue where Enhanced Bipod would combine the negative bonuses from both the normal and enhanced version due to both being provided from the Bungie API
- Fixed an issue where the community research sections would have too much spacing between line breaks
- Fixed an issue where the recoil direction display in Screenshot Mode wouldn't scale correctly at smaller screen sizes
- Changed the roll toolbar to wrap at smaller screen sizes since the horizontal scroll wasn't super clear
