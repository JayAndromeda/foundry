## Screenshot Mode

- Styles have been updated to match the UI changes from Lightfall
- Added a Settings popover within Screenshot Mode. You can now configure:
  - Displayed Power Level
  - Showing all Origin Traits, Activity Trackers, Infusion Socket, and Lock Icon
  - Damage Falloff, Handling Times, Reload Time display


## Roll Editor

- Fixed an issue where the base Intrinsic for Revision Zero and Vexcalibur would cause a client-side exception when selected
- Fixed an issue where visual stat values could go below 0
