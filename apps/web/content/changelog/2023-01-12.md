Hi! Going to start structuring these slightly differently to be scoped to the sections where changes/additions/fixes occurred.

## Weapon Page/Roll Editor

- Added "back" Screenshot Mode
  - It pops up in a modal now, it's not interactive, it works landscape at mobile, no, you cannot currently download it as an image
  - Please enjoy
- Added button to copy page permalink to clipboard
- Moved Compare button to header
- Changed the layout of the Roll Editor a bit, moved weapon metadata into a details pane to the right at desktop
- Started refining some components and animations

## Compare

- Made the header text smaller
