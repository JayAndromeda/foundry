## Roll Editor

- Added an option to toggle between PvP and PvE values
  - TTK will hide when PvE is selected
- Added a popover for changing Encounter data for PvE
  - Some basic activity presets have been added -- more to come
- Added an option to toggle between "Single select" and "Multi select" for perks.
  - If you multi select perks, a max of 3 per column will now show in Screenshot Mode
  - That's all you can really do with it currently more applications for this to come soon!

## Compare

- Changed up the UI a bit to work with the design system and to make scrolling a bit more natural on all screen sizes
- Added a back button to return to the previous page
- Changed table sections to be collapsible
- When hovering the weapon column header, added a button to "Collapse" the header and have the weapon cards take up less space
  - This should hopefully make it more usable on Mobile landscape
