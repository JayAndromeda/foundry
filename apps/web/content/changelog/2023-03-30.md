## Roll Editor

- Some of the new crafted weapons included extraneous Enhanced Intrinsics from the API for stats that don't exist on the weapon? These have been filtered out now.
- Fixed an issue where the select menu for Resilience in the Flinch Resist section could lay out underneath the page footer

## Calculator

- Fixed an issue where Charge Time and Draw Time Enhanced Intrinsics would not apply for advanced stats
- Fixed an issue where the Reload Speed stat bonus for Loader mods wouldn't display
