- Stats
  - Simplified the stat bar display. This is mainly because it's been a major cause of headaches trying to fit in more complex combinations of positive + negative values into that space, and I'd rather spend my time on other things right now.
    - No longer shows the Masterwork or Mod bonus as separate from the red/green delta bar.
    - We now will only show the red/green delta bars.
    - The stat number will still show as gold or blue depending on if a Masterwork or Mod is affecting that stat.
  - Fixed an issue with delta value for Magazine not showing the right number.
  - Fixed an issue with stat values not updating properly on Safari.
  - Changed the way animations for stat bar growth are handled.
- Screenshot Mode
  - Fixed an issue with enhanced traits not displaying
  - Adjusted text drop shadow
