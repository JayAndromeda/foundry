Hello Guardians,

It has been quite some time! Obviously still here considering the updates keep rolling out, and I hope you all have been enjoying the new features and have been cooking up some spicy god rolls. I owe you all a more proper blog post at... some point in the future. When the inspiration strikes me? But for now here's a quick recap of everything's that's launched in the past couple months:

- A weapon page UI that can scale with all we're adding
- A whole bunch of calculators
  - TTK, Damage Falloff, Handling, Reload, Flinch Resist and more!
  - These live in the accordion section and update while you select perks
- Selectable Perk effects
  - Preview your weapon's performance and stats at different stack levels!
  - See all our cool calculators update in real time!
- A revamped Screenshot Mode
  - It looks like in-game!
  - There's a settings menu in the top right that lets you change some display options
- Lots of new search filters
  - I really like the `trait_1` and `trait_2` ones for finding the perfect combos
- You can now download the site as an app (If you dare)
  - You can find the "Add to Home Screen" or "Download as app" button in your browser to get a slightly more focused version of Foundry!


Cool! That's it for this one.

â€“ Kat
