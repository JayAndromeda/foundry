Hello Guardians,

Hope you're all having a happy and healthy Dawning season. You may have noticed things look a little different over here.

Initially I started off this chunk of work with the intention to just give the home page a bit of a makeover, as well as to sort out the organization of some site-specific pages like the changelog, etc. This... then ballooned into a much larger project of further refining parts of the site's UI, and well, here we are!

Let me know what you all think about the upgrades, especially on mobile!

Keeping this one short and sweet. Thanks again for using the site, and a huge thanks to all the folks who have been giving me their feedback.

â€“ Kat
